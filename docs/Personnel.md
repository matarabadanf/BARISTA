 - Emma.py: In the context of excited state optimizations, to distinguish if different states fall to the same minima, the difference from the ground state structure can be seen by checking the RMSD of the resulting excited optimized structure. This script takes the ground state .xyz file and the list of optimized structures and plots the energy and RMSD of the excited state minima found. 
 - Rodrigo.py: Script to plot the UV absorption spectra from a TDDFT ORCA calculation with options such as cuttoff energies, peaks and units.  
 - Lorena: Script to shake the geometry of an xyz file.
